              h3 What is a hackathon?
              p A hackathon is an event, typically lasting 
                | multiple days, in which a large number of 
                | people meet to collaboratively build out their 
                | ideas using technology. We'll be partaking in 
                a(href="#") this 
                | kind of hacking, not 
                a(href="#") this 
                | kind.
            .qa
              h3 Who can attend?
              p Any college or high school students over 18 years of age from anywhere in the world are eligible. If you are enrolled at a UC campus but not yet 18, you are also eligible to participate. We wish we could invite minors but unfortunately cannot for legal reasons.
            .qa
              h3 What should I bring?
              p Bring your student ID, computer, any external peripherals you may need (chargers, monitors, etc.), any other hardware that you definitely plan on using, and an open mind. Also bring a change of clothes, a toothbrush, and any other toiletries you may need. You may also bring a sleeping bag if you plan to nap.

            .qa
              h3 What if I don't have a team?
              p We allow teams of up to four hackers. If you’re concerned that you may not have a team going in, no worries! We will host a team formation event at the beginning of the hackathon so that no one has to hack alone (unless they want to). If you do have a team, make sure everyone applies, and later on in the registration process, we will send out surveys to do our best to keep you with your team.
            .qa              
              h3 How do I get there?
              p We will send buses to most-- if not all-- undergraduate UC campuses. If you won’t be at or near a UC campus on September 30th, we will try our best to reimburse some of your travel expenses from wherever you are.
            .qa
              h3 Do I have to pay to get in?
              p Nope!
